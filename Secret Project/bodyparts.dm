			/*
			.:The Psionic Conflux:.
			As more and more thinking, feeling creatures evolve over time and reach sentience, a convergance of psionic brain waves gather into a nacent form in the space between spaces.
			This great Psionic stream pools slowly into higher dimensional space, just the same as gravity slowly bleeds into the space between universe membranes.
			From this rolling, primal storm of unbridled, untapped power is the potential for one to ascend to even higher states of godhood.

			- Player becomes aware of the Psionic Conflux once they unlock their first ascension
			- Been needing a way for players who ascend to gain more power and have another goal.
			- That new, higher goal could be tapping into a special universal cache of Psionic Power thats been sitting/building in the universe.
			- The idea is that a little bit of psionic power pools and collects into this cache every few months. Perhaps faster from players doing certain things?
			- Perhaps more Psionic power the more players that ascend also? This would encourage gods to help mortals ascend.
			- The more gods, the more excess psionic power is created?
			- Have the soul itself be an upgradeable part, and keep the other sins/virtues as part of the system

			.:What it gives in game:.

			For every upgrade of the soul, once ascended, have an option to do something fun

			- Convert a lump sum into lifespan
			- Convert a lump sum into resources
			- Convert a lump sum into a new mortal form, like the god emperor of mankind style and reincarnate
			- Convert a lump sum into divine energy
			- Convert a lump sum into dark matter
			- Convert a lump sum into a special spirit stone made from concentrated psionic power, which increases psionic power mod when absorbed
			- Convert a lump sum into a special follower made from psionic power
			- Convert a lump sum into a weapon
			- Add more psionic power to the pool
			- Convert a lump sum into a translocation stone, which lets you teleport once anywhere
			- Convert a lump sum into a permanment upgrade to a bodypart, allowing player to select a stat which is added to that part
			- Convert a lump sum into energy
			- Convert a lump sum into granting someone all their body parts as a Celestial/Demon
			- Convert a lump sum into infusing someones body parts with divine/dark energy in one burst
			- Convert a lump sum into lowering the cost of leveling the soul

		/*
				What we want for meridians is a way to basically use Xiandao type of cultivation. At the moment, we only really have body cultivation.
				The idea behind Xiandao for the most part is enhancing the meridians, and especially the dantian it connects to.
				So some ideas for Xiandao-style cultivation could be the following.

				.:The Dantian:.
				Every level that the dantian is increased by, sends a small wave of psionic power that levels up all the other meridians.
				Meridians can't be individually leveled like body parts, they are instead nourished/enhanced by the state of the dantian.
				What we're looking for here is fairly large spaces between power spikes to replicate the idea of "realms"
				Just before a dantian levels, it reaches a bottleneck, and players must push through in psionic storm tribulations to level the dantian
				Pushing through bottleneck completely empties the dantian
				Any divine energy left over is distributed to the meridians, giving them extra levels
				Any energy/psionic power left over given to player

				.:Filling the Dantian:.
				Fills slowly on own, quicker when meditating, quicker when meditating/breathing, fastest when meditating/breathing in place of power
				To fill the dantian, players must seek out places of energy. These are areas where psionic forces have gathered and become permeated in energy.
				Place examples, Soul Stream, special psionic/energy-saturated cave. Area on map where a psi-storm has manifested. Yukka tree, ect. Points of interest.
				Let players create energy gathering arrays using tech, which act as points of interest
				Being near these places or consuming things slowly "fills" the dantian, aka makes its exp bar rise.
				The process starts with gathering energy, which is converted by the brain into Psionic power (psionic brain waves), then the dantian converts psi power into divine energy
				Energy -> Psionic Power -> Divine Energy -> Dark Matter (Dead/Entropic divine energy)
				Being over your dantian limit slows the gathering quite a bit

				.:What it looks like in game:.
				Currently, it would just be sitting about waiting for the Dantian to fill. And maybe doing breathing. Could be boring?
				Staying in one area too long (map radius 100x100?) causes gains to stop
				Locating fresh places increases energy gathering
				Using Empty dantian option gives immediate boosts


				.:Triple cultivation:.
				Players can set their focus to psiforge, cultivate, gather belief
				Psiforge does what it does currently and sends all gains toward limb leveling
				Cultivate sends everything to the Dantian, filling it up slowly
				Gather belief attracts energy to the player from their followers


				.:Player options:.
				Player can interrupt the dantians "digestion" process for immeditate gains.
				Empty Dantian of energy - Empties the dantian of raw energy, giving it to the player
				Empty Dantian of psionic power - Empties the dantian of psionic power, giving it to the player
				Divine energy inside the dantian can either be used to break through bottlenecks, or for skills, ect
				Dantian can gather infinite divine energy, but it bottlenecks once a certain number is inside, which means players who horde it can't advance their power spikes unless tributlating


				.:Maths and Methods (MaD):.
				The players Divine Energy sits inside the dantian. So the players divine energy vars are just considered part of the dantian
				Cultivate (Or meditate?) slowly drains the players energy and sends it to the dantian
				Takes time for the Dantian to convert energy, Energy -> Psionic Power -> Divine Energy -> Dark Matter (Dead/Entropic divine energy)
				Miss out on Psiforging and Gathering while Cultivating
				Choosing a method locks the others, but can switch between them all
				Realms can be unlocked by all three Cultivation types. For example, a body cultivator levels their heart and gains enough to advance their realm. Or a Xiandao type manages to
				gather enough divine energy to advance. Whats important is getting enough Divine Energy to advance a realm.
				A player could body cultivate for half the time and gain divine energy, then switch to Xiandao cultivation and gain the rest needed, for example.

				.:Body Parts:.
				To stagger/limit the player, and also tie in Cultivation with Psiforging, each body part will be limited to level 100 until they breakthrough to the next realm
				Each realms gives +100 max body part levels
				Max body part level will then be 1000

				.:Ascension Milestones:.
				These are now a bit like body milestones, minor boosts along the way when doing different kinds of cultivation.

				.:Realms and Realm Levels:.
				Apparently the number 9 has a lot of symbolism in cultivation?
				9 levels to each realm
				Start at level 1, then at level 9 a tribulation can be challenged
				Each level before level 9 gives smaller bonus
				Once level 9 is completed, much bigger bonus

				.:Tribulations:.
				These are special storms, which can be challenged once the player reaches a bottleneck in their training.
				The divine energy inside the dantian is released,
				Summons a great psionic storm around the player.
				Maybe player has to survive being struck several times?
				Maybe Psionic demons attack the player too?
				If the player fails to pass, they lose a little of their divine energy
				If the player fails to pass, they could become very injured or even die (Can become injured even if suceeded)

				.:Golden Core Quality:.



				.:Realms:.
				Realms range in level from 1-9, and breaking through enters a new Realm.

				Pre-Psionic
					Description: This where our player starts. Their body parts can't level past 100 while here.
					Gains:
				Post-Psionic
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
					Description: This is where our players will be once they become sensitive to Psionic Power
				Psionic Condensation
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
					Description: An initial stage of cultivation which involves absorbing Qi from the natural world and refining it inside the body.
				Foundation Establishment
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
					Description: The stage after Qi Condensation. Once a cultivator’s Qi crosses a certain threshold (in the volume and/or density of the Qi),
					they’ll be able to breakthrough to this stage.
				Core Formation
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
					It involves forming a Golden Core by using the Dantian as a crucible and the Cultivation Base as raw material.
				Nascent Soul
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
					Description: The stage after Core Formation (in some novels). The Nascent Soul resembles an infant or miniature person and resides in the Dantian,
					typically sitting in a meditative position. In some novels, the Nascent Soul can travel outside the body and is like a second life for cultivators - if their
					main body dies, their consciousness can continue to exist in the Nascent Soul. For Yukopians, this is where they need to link their soul with the Yukka tree.
					They unlock a special ascension milestone to link before being able to pass their
					tribulation.
				Soul Formation
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
				Demigod
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
				Godhood
					+100 max levels to body parts once reached
					+10 levels to all body parts
					Description: The stage wherein the cultivator becomes a Daoist Immortal. There are many differences between novels, but usually the cultivation/maturation of
					the Golden Core or Nascent Soul plays a key role in ascending to Immortality.
